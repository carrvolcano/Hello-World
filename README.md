# Hello-World
Practice flow

Trying to save code for geochemical inverse modeling using rare earth elements.
Wrote my first program in 1965.
Nearly failed until I accepted "Let x=x+1".
Most of the languages I learned are now extinct; BASIC (Dartmouth), Basica (Microsoft) etc.
The code I will save here is in Xojo, a descendent of BASIC.

Retired professor with nothing better to do than be confused by evolving programming environments.
